Artificial misalignment
-----------------------

This dataset tries to overcome the problem of needing manual alignment
of scores to audio for training models which exploit audio and scores at
the both time. The underlying idea is that we have many scores and a lot
of audio and users of trained models could easily take advantage of such
multimodality (the ability of the model to exploit both scores and
audio). The main problem is the annotation stage: we have quite a lot of
aligned data, but we miss the corresponding scores, and if we have the
scores, we almost always miss the aligned performance.

The approach used is to statistical analyze the available manual
annotations and to reproduce it. Indeed, with ``misaligned`` data I mean
data which try to reproduce the statistical features of the difference
between scores and aligned data.

Old description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For now, the statistical analysis is damn simple: I compute the mean and
the standard deviation of offsets and onsets for each piece. Then, I
take memory of the standardized histogram and of the histograms of means
and standard deviations. To create new misaligned data, I chose a
standardized value for each note and a mean and a standard deviation for
each piece, using the corresponding histograms; with these data, I can
compute a non-standardized value for each note. Note that the histograms
are first normalized so that they accomplish to given constraints. In
the present code, the standardized values are normalized to 1 (that is,
the maximum value is 1 second), while standard deviations are normalized
to 0.2 (see ``conversion_tool.py`` lines ``17-21``).

New description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can evaluate the various approach by running ``python -m
asmd.alignment_stats``. The script will use Eita Nakamura method to match notes
between the score and the performance and will collect statistics only on the
matched notes; it will then compute the distance between the misaligned score
onset/offset sequence and the real score onset sequence, considering only the
matchng notes, using the L1 error between matching notes.  The evaluation uses
`vienna_corpus`, `traditional_flute`, `MusicNet`, `Bach10` and `asap` group
from `Maestro` dataset for a total of 875 scores, split in train-set and
test-set with 70-30 proportion, resulting in 641 songs for training and 234
songs for testing.

However, since Eita's method takes a long time on some scores, I removed the
scores for which Eita's method ends after 20 seconds; this resulted in a total
of 347 songs for training and ~143 songs for testing (~54% and ~61% of the
total number of songs with an available score).

Both the two compared methods are based on the random choice of a standard
deviation and a mean for the whole song according to the collected
distributions of standard deviations and means. Statistics are collected for
onsets differences and duration ratios between performance and score. After the
estimation of new onsets and offsets, onsets a sorted and offsets are made
lower than the next onsets with the same pitch. 

The two methods differ for how the standardized misalignment is computed/generated:

* old method randomly choses it according to the collected distribution
* new method uses an HMM with Gaussian mixture emissions instead of a simple
  distribution

Moreover, the misaligned data are computed with models trained on the stretched
scores, so that the training data consists of scores at the same average BPM as
the performance; the misaligned data, then, consists of times at that average
BPM.

The following table resumes the results of the comparison:

+------+---------------+--------------+
|      | Ons           | Offs         |
+------+---------------+--------------+
| HMM  | 18.6 ± 49.7   | 20.7 ± 50.6  |
+------+---------------+--------------+
| Hist | 7.43 ± 15.5   | 8.95 ± 15.5  |
+------+---------------+--------------+

Misaligned data are finally created by training GMM-HMM on all the 875 scores
(~481 considering songs where Eita's method takes less than 20 sec).
Misaligned data are more similar to a new performance than to a symbolic score;
for most of MIR applications, however, misaligned data are enough for both
training and evaluation.

BPM for `score` alignment
-------------------------

Previously, the BPM was always forced to 20, so that, if the BPM is not
available, notes duration can still be expressed in seconds.

Since 0.4, the BPM is simply set to 60 if not available; however, positions of
beats are always provided, so that the user can reconstruct the instant BPM.
The function ``get_initial_bpm`` from the Python API also provides a way to
retrieve the initial instant BPM from the score.

An easy way to get an approximative BPM, is to `stretch` the score to the
duration of the corresponding performance. This can also be done for the beats,
and consequently, for the instant BPM. For instance, let `T_0` and `T_1` be the
initial and ending time of the performance, and let `t_0` and `t_1` be the initial
and ending times of the score. Then, the stretched times of the score at the
average performance BPM are given by:

`t_new = (t_old - t_0) * (T_1 - T_0) + T_0`

where `t_old` is an original time instant in the score and `t_new` is the new time
instant after the stretching. Applying this formula to the beat times can help
you to compute the new instant BPM while keeping the same average BPM as the
performance. This functionality is provided by ``asmd.utils.mat_stretch`` for
onsets and offsets, but not for beats yet.
